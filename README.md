# ssh-hangman

An ssh server that plays hangman.

The code quality/standards here are kinda low since this was hacked out in a
coding race against a ruby ninja (to see how had hangman going quicker).

<!-- I can't remember if I won because this happened ages ago and I just found
this code lying around -->


## Usage

```sh
$ make
$ ./hangman

$ ssh -p 2222 localhost
```
